This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to type juggling and range checks. The `bug.php` file contains a function that incorrectly handles comparisons when mixed numeric and string types are used as inputs. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version using strict type comparisons to avoid these issues.  The bug highlights the importance of using strict comparison operators (=== and !==) when dealing with numerical ranges in PHP to prevent unexpected behavior.
